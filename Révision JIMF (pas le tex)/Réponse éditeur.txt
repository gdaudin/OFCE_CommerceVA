Reviewer #1: This paper uses an accounting approach to estimate the elasticity of the household consumption expenditure (HCE) deflator to the exchange rate.  After estimating these elasticities for many countries, it explores their heterogeneity across countries and over time. The authors find that countries the consume a larger share of imported goods and services experience higher elasticities. Countries vary in the determinants of the HCE deflator elasticity (e.g. consumption of domestic vs. imported good; sector composition). Changes in the use of imported inputs have affected the value of these elasticities over time. Finally, the authors show that the estimated elasticities are well predicted by the share of imported consumption good in GDP and the share of imported inputs in GDP.


*	The paper is difficult to read. Part of it is the organisation of the information and another part of it is the exposition.  I understand input-output linkages well and still had to think hard about all the relationships discussed in section 2, and various parts of the paper (I'll be specific in my comments below).

We strive to simplify the exposition of the information and to better organize the paper. 
For instance, we moved some parts of Section 2 to the appendix. 
To simplify the main text and make it easier to read, we have put some technical explanations in footnotes.

*	The analysis makes assumptions on the degree of the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) and currency pricing. These assumptions imply estimated elasticities are an upper bound.  It would be great if the authors could incorporate a discussion of the consequences of this for their findings.  While I do agree the assumptions bias estimates elasticities upwards, I am not sure the cross-country heterogeneity is correctly identified. If one looks at Figure 1, Taiwan has a greater elasticity than Canada but that might not be the case if the bias from the assumptions on Taiwan's calculations is worse than that on Canada's.  This point is particularly important given that cross-country heterogeneity is explored in section 3.1. and 3.2.

*	The language in the introduction is not always clear. For example: "we assume that the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation is proportional across sector". At page 1 I was not sure to what the proportionality referred, only in section 2.3 I understood that it referred to the use of inputs whose price is affected. 

I also found confusing the discussion of channels iii) and iv) at page 2. Most readers are unfamiliar with input-output structures and have not thought of all the ways in which shocks propagate from one country to another through input-output linkages.

We simplified the discussion on channels iii) and iv) and redrafted the introduction as follows:
"We look into the determinants of the HCE deflator elasticity and the role of global value chains in the transmission of an exchange rate appreciation. 
We identify the main channels through which the exchange rate impacts the HCE deflator when production processes are global.
We find that the main transmission channels are:
i) the prices of imported ﬁnal goods sold directly to domestic consumers and
ii) the prices of imported inputs entering domestic production. 
These two channels explain three-quarters of the transmission of an exchange rate appreciation to domestic prices.
By contrast, other channels reflecting the impact of global value chains (such as the price of exported inputs feeding through imported foreign production) play a more limited role, with marked cross-countries heterogeneity.
Hence, only one-fourth of the elasticity of the HCE deflator to the exchange rate is attributable to participation in global value chains."

*	In the introduction, main findings are discussed only for the third and fourth exercise in the paper but not for the first two 

As suggested, we redrafted the introduction in order to discuss the main findings of all the exercises performed in the paper. 
To do so, we added a short summary of the section which focuses on the impact of an appreciation of the US dollar:

"We analyse the impact on the domestic economy of variations in the currency of their trading partners. 
We show that countries are affected in proportion to their trading links with the country whose currency appreciates. 
For example, we estimate the impact of an appreciation of the US dollar." 

We also strive to better emphasize our contribution to the literature when we refer to the extrapolations performed with up-to-date trade and GDP statistics: 

"We show that a precise assessment of the HCE deflator elasticity to the exchange rate can be estimated for recent years without resorting to WIOTs. 
The construction of World Input- Output tables is data-demanding and WIOTs are typically released with a lag of several years.
As a result, WIOTs are not available for the most recent years. For instance, the latest WIOD
dataset dates back to 2014. Although the MRIO dataset covers most recent years, it suffers from data quality issues in 2018. 
To address the data gap in WIOTs, we extrapolate the HCE deflator elasticity from 2015 onwards using up-to-date GDP statistics and trade data on consumption
and intermediates. 
We obtain a reliable estimate of the HCE deflator elasticity up to to 2019.
While most of the existing literature focuses on average elasticities, computed over a period covering several years, extrapolations allow us to analyse how elasticities change in a more up-to-date way, from one year to another."  

We also stress the fact that we used several datasets for the sake of robustness, which is seldom the case in the existing lierature: 
"Last but not least, we use several WIOTs databases for the sake of robustness (i.e. WIOD, two distinct releases
of the OECD TiVA database and the MRIO database), which is seldom the case in the existing literature. 
Results from different WIOTs converge."


*	The motivation and contribution of the paper to the literature should be included in the introduction.  

We try to better motivate our paper by adding the following sentences at the beginning of the introduction:

"Over the past two decades, the rise of global value chains has led to a greater use of input-output tables to study international linkages. 
In this paper, we analyse which countries are most vulnerable to cost-push inflation using world input-output tables. 
We also document the heterogeneous reactions of consumer prices to exchange rate variations across countries, reflecting differences in foreign product content of consumption and intermediate products. 
Understanding the influence of exchange rate on inflation is indeed critically important for setting monetary policy and measuring the extent of expenditure switching that follows exchange rate variations, which, in turn, has an impact on real activity.
To shed light on these mechanisms, we study the elasticity of the household consumption expenditure (HCE hereafter) deflator to the exchange rate."

Section 1 could be thus incorporated in the introduction.

We shortened Section 1 and incorporated it in the introduction. 

*	I would consider dropping section 1, but including a deeper and more concise discussion of the related literature.  This paper relates to the ERPT literature but also to the large macro-trade literature that sheds light on the transmission of shocks across countries through input-output linkages. The contribution of the paper to each of these strands should be clearly discussed.

*	Section 2 should be re-organised. The focus of the section should be on the derivation of the HCE deflator elasticity. The data could be discussed in a separate section.

As suggested, we re-organised Section 2. 
We now discuss the data sources and compare the different databases in a separate section (section 1). 
As a result, Section 2 now only focuses on the derivation of the HCE deflator elasticity.

*	I am unsure of the purpose of section 2.1.   I am guessing the authors wanted to show that the effect of a change in production costs is different from that due to a change in the exchange rate. But isn't that shown in Online Appendix D?

Thank you for this comment. This section was meant initially as an introduction to the rest of the analysis, but we agree it was actually redundant. We have moved it to Online Appendix. 

*	The analysis in section 4.3 is poorly explained. Are all countries included when equation (17) is estimated? What are the estimated coefficients? Why is the estimated specification that in equation (17)? What happens if the time-varying variables are replaced by time fixed-effects?

Thank you for this comment. We have changed that section. We now explain why we do not use the time-fixed effects. We give and comment the regression results of equation 17 (now 16) (and explain why we are more interested in the goodness-of-fit than the coefficient value and coefficients). We give the number of countries and years over which the equation is estimated. We hope to have thus clarified the discussion and answered your concerns

*	For the exercise in 4.3 to be helpful, it would be good if the authors could validate their estimated elasticities. Is there any other study that for a subset of the sampled countries has obtained relatively precise estimated HCE deflator elasticities?  In the abstract, the authors mention their elasticity estimates are in line with the literature- so that should be feasible. A lot of the correlations highlighted in the paper feel mechanical.

Thank you for bringing these aspects to our attention : they have been dealt with.
