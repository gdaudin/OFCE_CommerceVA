  abstract = {This paper argues that, in the presence of intersectoral input\textendash output linkages, microeconomic idiosyncratic shocks may lead to aggregate fluctuations. We show that, as the economy becomes more disaggregated, the rate at which aggregate volatility decays is determined by the structure of the network capturing such linkages. Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of ``cascade effects'' whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the ``sparseness'' of the input\textendash output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.},

  abstract = {The propagation of macroeconomic shocks through input-output and geographic networks can be a powerful driver of macroeconomic fluctuations. We first exposit that in the presence of Cobb-Douglas production functions and consumer preferences, there is a specific pattern of economic transmission whereby demand-side shocks propagate upstream (to input-supplying industries) and supply-side shocks propagate downstream (to customer industries) and that there is a tight relationship between the direct impact of a shock and the magnitudes of the downstream and the upstream indirect effects. We then investigate the short-run propagation of four different types of industry-level shocks: two demand-side ones (the exogenous component of the variation in industry imports from China and changes in federal spending) and two supply-side ones (TFP shocks and variation in knowledge/ideas coming from foreign patenting). In each case, we find substantial propagation of these shocks through the input-output network, with a pattern broadly consistent with theory. Quantitatively, the network-based propagation is larger than the direct effects of the shocks. We also show quantitatively large effects from the geographic network, capturing the fact that the local propagation of a shock to an industry will fall more heavily on other industries that tend to collocate with it across local markets. Our results suggest that the transmission of various different types of shocks through economic networks and industry interlinkages could have first-order implications for the macroeconomy.},

This is expected to affect the production and consumer prices of electricity. The changes in electricity prices are then reflected in production costs in other segments of the economy. Subsequently, producer and consumer prices will be affected. The potential impact of the changes in electricity prices that the ongoing electricity reforms in Turkey will bring about may have important implications on the price formation in economic activities and the cost of living for households. This paper evaluates the potential impacts of changes in electricity prices from a social accounting matrix (SAM) price modeling perspective. It is found that based on the estimated price multipliers that prices in the energy-producing sectors, mining, and iron and steel manufacturing sectors would be affected more severely than the remaining sectors of the economy. Consumer prices are affected slightly less than producer prices.},

We perform the analysis by combining two datasets \textendash{} highly disaggregated trade data from UN Comtrade with internationally integrated Supply and Use Tables from the WIOD database. The inclusion of international fragmentation alters the underlying story behind changes in market shares between 1995 and 2011. The ongoing global outsourcing affects market shares directly by shifting production from G7 to BRIC countries. Moreover, accounting for real providers of the value added alters the balance between price and non-price drivers of global market shares. Changes in relative quality of countries' exports are mainly due to intermediate inputs, not due to domestic production. For instance, the seemingly improved or unchanged relative quality of BRIC export goods largely arose from outsourcing rather than from improvements in the quality of domestic production. In most cases, the dynamics of the value-added market shares is dominated by price and cost factors.},

At the usual level of aggregation, they contain nodes with strong self-loops and are almost completely connected. We derive two measures of node centrality that are well suited for such networks. Both are based on random walks and have interpretations as the propagation of supply shocks through the economy. Random walk centrality reveals the vertices most immediately affected by a shock. Counting betweenness identifies the nodes where a shock lingers longest. The two measures differ in how they treat self-loops. We apply both to data from a wide set of countries and uncover salient characteristics of the structures of these national economies. We further validate our indices by clustering according to sectors' centralities. This analysis reveals geographical proximity and similar developmental status.

  abstract = {The past decades have witnessed a rapid globalisation of economic activity which has significantly changed the outlook of the world economy. International production, trade and investments are increasingly organised within so-called global value chains (GVCs) where the different stages in the production process are located across different economies. Until now, GVCs have been largely discussed from a conceptual and theoretical view, but empirical work on international fragmentation has stayed a bit behind. The review of the available data and indicators on GVCs in this paper shows the increasing importance of GVCs in today's global economy, but at the same time clearly highlights some major shortcomings. While the empirical evidence based on trade data is less convincing, Input-Output data clearly reveal the growing spread of interna tional production networks. Indicators on imported intermediates, offshoring and vertical specialisation all illustrate the growing fragmentation of production across more economies. Trade data seem to show the increasing importance of GVCs only in an indirect way but the existing trade data are not detailed enough and are not collected on the right level of analysis to analyse the international fragmentation and GVCs. Policy makers show an increasing interest in GVCs because of the pervasive effects GVCs have on national economies and are especially looking for more and better policy evidence. Important policy issues like the impact of GVCs on the competitiveness of countries and attractiveness for international investments can only be addressed by new and better metrics. The OECD is developing new empirical evidence studying the emergence of GVCs based on international trade data and Input-Output data. In addition, the OECD is currently cooperating with other international agencies and academic experts to develop new metrics for GVCs, for example data on trade in value added.},

  abstract = {Global value chain participation affects the exchange rate pass-through to export prices and export volumes. The paper develops a partial equilibrium model of international trade with cross-border production and shows that higher participation in global value chains reduces the elasticities. Specifically, a higher share of foreign value added in exports reduces the exchange rate pass-through to export prices and export volumes. A greater share of exports that return as imports also reduces the responsiveness of export volumes to changes in bilateral exchange rates. Finally, exports of inputs that are further re-exported increase the responsiveness to the trading partner's effective exchange rate. Using a novel sector-level panel dataset with 40 countries, the analysis tests and finds strong empirical support for the theoretical predictions. The paper further shows that some sectors in some countries can even experience a decline in gross exports when their currency depreciates.},

A report to the National Research Council identified this assumption as being a significant limitation of current data collection and analysis. In this note we move beyond this assumption to obtain a direct measure of imported materials by industry for the United States in 1997. At the 3-digit I-O industry level, there is a correlation of 0.68 between the offshoring shares made with and without the proportionality assumption, and a higher correlation of 0.87 when the shares are value weighted. While most value-weighted industry have differences below 50 percentage points in the two estimates, there is significant number of cases that differ by 10 percentage points or more.},

We study alternative models of diffusion on networks and we calibrate them using input-output data on real-world inter-sectoral dependencies for several European countries before the Great Depression. We show that the impact of economic shocks strongly depends on the nature of the shock and country size. Shocks that impact on final demand without changing production and the technological relationships between sectors have on average a large but very homogeneous impact on the economy. Conversely, when shocks change also the magnitudes of input-output across-sector interdependencies (and possibly sector production), the economy is subject to predominantly large but more heterogeneous avalanche sizes. In this case, we also find that (i) the more a sector is globally central in the country network, the larger its impact; (ii) the largest European countries, such as those constituting the core of the European Union's economy, typically experience the largest avalanches, signaling their intrinsic higher vulnerability to economic shocks.},

Analyses based on international input-output tables can help address  trade-related policy issues as well as providing other insights into the socio-economic and environmental  impacts of globalisation.

While the main focus is on the increasing presence of  ``re-exports'' in reported exports of goods data, this paper also addresses some other statistical and data  issues that need to be considered, such as treatment of confidential (or ``unallocated'') trade in goods; trade  in secondhand goods, scrap metal and other waste; differences in trade statistics across international  statistical agencies; and the additional problems encountered when converting product-based trade data to  industry-based classifications. Issues concerning Balance of Payments data, the main source for trade in  services, are also addressed},

Production processes increasingly involve a sequential, vertical trading chain stretching across many countries, with each country specializing in particular stages of a good's production sequence. We document a key aspect of these vertical linkages--the use of imported inputs in producing goods that are exported -- which we call vertical specialization. Using input-output tables from the OECD and emerging market countries we estimate that vertical specialization accounts for up to 30 percent of world exports, and has grown as much as 40 percent in the last twenty-five years. The key insight about why vertical specialization has grown so much lies with the fact that trade barriers (tariffs and transportation costs) are incurred repeatedly as goods-in-process cross multiple borders. Hence, even small reductions in tariffs and transport costs can lead to extensive vertical specialization, large trade growth, and large gains from trade. We formally illustrate these points by developing an extension of the Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson ricardian trade model.{$<$}br{$><$}small{$>$}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.){$<$}/small{$>$}},

Across sectors, the VAX ratio for Manufactures is low relative to Services, primarily because Services are used as an intermediate to produce manufacturing exports. Across bilateral partners, VAX ratios vary widely and contain information on both bilateral and triangular production chains. We document specifically that bilateral production linkages, not variation in the composition of exports, drive variation in bilateral VAX ratios. Finally, bilateral imbalances measured in value added differ from gross trade imbalances.

Both quantitative and qualitative regularities were observed across the OECD economies. Specifically, flow sizes and industry sizes appear to follow the same distribution for all OECD countries; the overall structure of flows within the network, as characterized by the relative amount of cycled and first-passage flow, followed a similar pattern for most OECD countries; and similar groups of closely connected sectors were found. More work needs to be done to understand these results in depth. Directions for future research are outlined; in particular, exploring (1) the stability of these results to IO data with different levels of detail, (2) community structure within the IO networks, and (3) generative/dynamic models of IO networks.},

In this framework, knowing the bilateral details of each country's input\dbend output structure is key to the correct calculation of the factor content of trade. Because input\dbend output tables typically lack this detail, TZ impute the relevant input\dbend output coefficients by making a proportionality assumption. This paper uses survey-based input\dbend output coefficients from the Asian Input\dbend output (AIO) tables that do provide bilateral details. Exploiting methodological differences in the compilation of the AIO tables and the data underlying TZ studies, this paper empirically assesses how well the TZ approach fits sourcing patterns of inputs and finds that it understates countries' use and relative use of foreign inputs, especially in those sectors where they are most used. As a result countries' use of domestic factors is overstated. Biases generated on exported and imported factor services cancel each other out. The net effect on the measured factor trade is small.},

Hence, it is expected that any change in the size of these subsidies influences the price of the relative sectors through the intermediate expenditures. This paper aims at developing the Table Adjusting Price (TAP) and Standard Leontief Price (SLP) models to measure the effect of an exogenous change in the size of implicit subsidy on the price indices of all sectors. The proposed models allowed the researcher to analyse a change in the level of implicit subsidy in different cases.

In certain situations, however, policies or uncontrollable factors induce exogenous changes in gross industry output. Application of the usual Leontief multipliers in these cases will lead to biased calculations of backward linked economy-wide effects. To eliminate this bias, an output-based adjustment method is proposed that relates demand-driven Leontief multipliers to exogenous output shocks. It is demonstrated that this approach yields exactly the same results as the mixed exogenous/endogenous variables technique, a commonly employed adaptation procedure that accepts outputs as entries. The equivalence between these two approaches is important, because the output-based approach offers substantial computational savings through ease of implementation within ready-made regional input-output systems and provides practitioners with the ability to generate disaggregated estimates of indirect multiplier effects.},

Based on quarterly frequency data, the analysis covers the period 1996Q1-2015Q2. Two alternative measures of the nominal exchange rate are used: the NEER of the euro against 38 partners and the EUR/USD bilateral exchange rate. The results show that the pass through is only ``partial'' in the euro area, most probably reflecting slow nominal price adjustments and the pricing-to-market behaviour of firms. We find clear evidence that the degree of pass through has been declining over the past two decades. Interestingly, the period of strong fall of pass through coincides with the increasing share of the emerging countries in world trade and the accession of China to the WTO. Looking at the largest euro area countries, we find striking heterogeneities in the degree but also in the speed of the ERPT. The lowest degree of pass through of a change in NEER is found for Germany while it is the highest for Italy. In addition, unlike the other large euro area countries, we do not find evidence for Italy of a decline in the degree of pass through over time. In a monetary union, such differences may signal large heterogeneities in domestic markets structures.},

Using these measures, we characterize cross-country production sharing patterns and their evolution for 56 sectors and 44 countries over 2000-2014.

  abstract = {Input-output (I-O) analysis has been around for n early 70 years, and although its use has ebbed and  flowed over the years, it has always retained a dedicated core of users in the worldwide research  community. Recently however, there seems to have been a notable increase in the use of input-output  tables in empirical analyses addressing a wide range of policy issues. This is partly due to the improved  availability and quality of national input-output tables as well as modern IT capabilities allowing more  complex analyses to be undertaken by more researchers. A quick glance through recent editions of the  journal  Economic Systems Research  confirms the variety of research topics that can benefit from input- output analysis as does a recent user survey conducted by OECD.  This paper is primarily aimed at a non-technical audience and focuses on the applications and  important policy questions that can benefit from the availability of harmonised input-output tables, such as  those developed over the years by the OECD. The additional benefits of linking such tables via bilateral  trade matrices, to produce inter-country input-output m odels, are also outlined. The paper describes current  uses of such models and their potential contribution to understanding a range of issues such as global value  chains and production fragmentation; technology  flows; productivity and determinants of growth;  industrial ecology and sustainable development. Current constraints of the international harmonised tables  produced by OECD are also discussed and overviews of relevant literature are included which cover the  economic and environmental questions that can be addressed. By raising awareness of the analytical  possibilities of input-output tables amongst policy analysts, we hope to encourage further widespread use  of OECD\'is harmonised input-output tables and provide the impetus for continued development of multi- country input-output tables linked by trade data.  Technical details of how national and OECD harmoni sed input-output tables are constructed, and in  particular how the closely related supply-use tables are converted into symmetric input-output tables, are  not covered here \~n they are described in a related paper (Yamano and Ahmad, 2006).},

  abstract = {Many countries have been affected by food and oil price shocks. Rising energy costs have manifested themselves through higher prices of gas at the pump and through price increases for many other goods such as kerosene and transport. But in some countries there has also been some degree of protection for consumers for example when authorities have chosen to try to keep electricity tariffs affordable through implicit subsidies (which are unfortunately often poorly targeted). For food prices, the effect on consumers has often been more rapid than for oil-related products, as the increase in import prices have been typically fully passed on to consumers and has often been accompanied by increases in the prices of domestically produced foods. Recent attention has therefore rightly been focused on food prices, but the issue of oil prices is important as well. While food prices tend to have a larger direct impact on consumers due to the larger share of food in total household consumption, oil prices may have larger multiplier effects than food prices because oil-related products are used as intermediary products in many productive sectors. It therefore remains an open question as to whether the medium-term impact of food or oil prices is likely to be larger in any given country. It also remains open to question as to whether urban as opposed to rural households are most likely to be affected. While urban households are likely to rely on consumption of imported goods more than rural households, the weight of food and possibly oil-related products may well be larger in the consumption patterns of rural than urban households. Answering these questions may be useful to guide discussions on compensatory measures that governments can take to respond to the twin crisis of higher food and oil prices. In this context the objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the multiplier impact of both types of price shocks using a recent Social Accounting Matrix for Ghana. The paper finds that both the direct impacts of food prices and the indirect impacts of oil prices are potentially large, so that both should be dealt with by authorities when considering compensatory measures to protect households from higher consumer prices.},

  abstract = {The development of the OECD\'is input-output database started over a decade ago and is currently  undergoing its second update. Over the years, the database has been used in a number of analytical  applications both within and outside the OECD. Two major applications within the OECD concerned the  analysis of the diffusion of embodied technology and, more recently, the measurement of carbon dioxide  emissions embodied in the international trade of goods. The latest update is being conducted as part of an  OECD project looking at global value chains. This pa per describes how the database has developed over  the last decade, both from a collection and a compilation perspective, and some of the thinking behind the  various assumptions used during compilation and the various pre-requisite data needed to compile the  tables. The paper also outlines the rationale for producing these harmonised tables on an  industry-by-industry basis rather than product-by-product; partly reflecting the importance of linking the  tables to many other OECD databases. The purpose of the paper is therefore twofold. The first is to  describe the database and its uses. The second is to describe the OECD\'is experience in the compilation of  these tables in the hope that this may benefit input-output compilers in national statistical offices and  provide them with a better understanding of the inform ation needed by the OECD to compile these tables  in order to meet the demands of users},

Supply-side (productivity) shocks impact the industry itself and those consuming its goods, while a demand-side shock affects the industry and its suppliers. The authors also find that the initial impact of an industry shock can be substantially amplified due to input-output linkages.},

This column, using firm-level data from Sweden, shows that as firms' share of in-house services increases, so does their export intensity. The increasing complementarities between services and trade in goods thus imply that the different trade policies for goods and services are an antiquated divide.},
