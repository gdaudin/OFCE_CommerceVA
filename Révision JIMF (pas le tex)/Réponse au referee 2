Reviewer #1: Dear Authors,
Thank you for all your work on your manuscript and response to my comments. The paper is much improved and my previous comments satisfactorily addressed. I do not have major additional comments, but just a few minor ones:

- At page 11, I found the example in the second paragraph confusing. Why prices of country B's inputs imported by A do not change? They should as they include inputs from A. Because you later are very clear about the direct and indirect effects of an appreciation, you might want to consider dropping this introductory example.
- At page 20, what is the overall correlation between your estimates and Aydogus et al. (2018)'s?
We responded to this comment by adding the following sentence: "

- I initially had trouble downloading the online appendix, and looked for it on the github repository listed in the acknowledgements. Navigating it is not obvious, the readme file is 6 years old and I could not find the online Appendix. I recommend that you re-organise the repository to facilitate navigation update the readme file, and include the Online Appendix.
- I found a few typos and missing determinative articles. It would be good if you could have the manuscript proofread.
