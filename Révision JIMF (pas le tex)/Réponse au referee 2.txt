Reviewer #1: Dear Authors,
Thank you for all your work on your manuscript and response to my comments. The paper is much improved and my previous comments satisfactorily addressed. I do not have major additional comments, but just a few minor ones:

- At page 11, I found the example in the second paragraph confusing. Why prices of country B's inputs imported by A do not change? They should as they include inputs from A. Because you later are very clear about the direct and indirect effects of an appreciation, you might want to consider dropping this introductory example.
You are right :  there was a mistake. We have replaced 
Conversely, the price of imported inputs in country $A$ remains constant in dollars, since the prices of country $B$ have not changed, and declines once expressed in country $A$'s national currency. 
by
Conversely, the price of imported inputs in country $A$ in dollars increase since the prices of country $B$ have increased to accomodate more expensive inputs from country $A$. Prices in country $A$ in national currency decline however, as this effect is more than counter-balanced by the appreciation of country $A$'s national currency.


- At page 20, what is the overall correlation between your estimates and Aydogus et al. (2018)'s?
We added the following sentence to address your comment: "Overall, the correlation coefficient between our respective estimates, computed on a sample of 26 countries, is 0.7." 


- I initially had trouble downloading the online appendix, and looked for it on the github repository listed in the acknowledgements. Navigating it is not obvious, the readme file is 6 years old and I could not find the online Appendix. I recommend that you re-organise the repository to facilitate navigation update the readme file, and include the Online Appendix.
- I found a few typos and missing determinative articles. It would be good if you could have the manuscript proofread.
