Thank you very much for this opportunity...


I have completed my evaluation of your manuscript. The reviewer recommends reconsideration of your manuscript following revision and modification.

I invite you to resubmit your manuscript after addressing the comments below. Please resubmit your revised manuscript by Sep 01, 2022.  Most of the concerns are expositional in nature. Since the JIMF audience is not necessarily familiar with input-output analyses and the derivation of these types of indices, it is critical that the  layout be as clear as possible.

When revising your manuscript, please consider all issues mentioned in the reviewer's comments carefully: please outline every change made in response to their comments and provide suitable rebuttals for any comments not addressed. Please note that your revised submission may need to be re-reviewed.    

To submit your revised manuscript, please log in as an author at https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.editorialmanager.com%2Fjimf%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cguillaume.daudin%40dauphine.psl.eu%7C5967814d507f45ffdbfa08da5d5a8179%7C81e7c4de26c94531b076b70e2d75966e%7C0%7C0%7C637924940547935926%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=M1MaAWsyc9oJ4aBlsANSJstad0yJWevp71EyRt2Q6Ww%3D&amp;reserved=0, and navigate to the "Submissions Needing Revision" folder under the Author Main Menu.

Reviewer #1: This paper uses an accounting approach to estimate the elasticity of the household consumption expenditure (HCE) deflator to the exchange rate.  After estimating these elasticities for many countries, it explores their heterogeneity across countries and over time. The authors find that countries the consume a larger share of imported goods and services experience higher elasticities. Countries vary in the determinants of the HCE deflator elasticity (e.g. consumption of domestic vs. imported good; sector composition). Changes in the use of imported inputs have affected the value of these elasticities over time. Finally, the authors show that the estimated elasticities are well predicted by the share of imported consumption good in GDP and the share of imported inputs in GDP.


*	The paper is difficult to read. Part of it is the organisation of the information and another part of it is the exposition.  I understand input-output linkages well and still had to think hard about all the relationships discussed in section 2, and various parts of the paper (I'll be specific in my comments below).

*	The analysis makes assumptions on the degree of the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) and currency pricing. These assumptions imply estimated elasticities are an upper bound.  It would be great if the authors could incorporate a discussion of the consequences of this for their findings.  While I do agree the assumptions bias estimates elasticities upwards, I am not sure the cross-country heterogeneity is correctly identified. If one looks at Figure 1, Taiwan has a greater elasticity than Canada but that might not be the case if the bias from the assumptions on Taiwan's calculations is worse than that on Canada's.  This point is particularly important given that cross-country heterogeneity is explored in section 3.1. and 3.2.

*	The language in the introduction is not always clear. For example: "we assume that the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation is proportional across sector". At page 1 I was not sure to what the proportionality referred, only in section 2.3 I understood that it referred to the use of inputs whose price is affected.  I also found confusing the discussion of channels iii) and iv) at page 2. Most readers are unfamiliar with input-output structures and have not thought of all the ways in which shocks propagate from one country to another through input-output linkages.

We simplified the discussion on channels as follows:
"Third, we look into the determinants of the HCE deflator elasticity and the role of global value chains in the transmission of an exchange rate appreciation. 
We identify the main channels through which the exchange rate impacts the HCE deflator when production processes are global.
We find that the main transmission channels are:
i) the prices of imported ﬁnal goods sold directly to domestic consumers and
ii) the prices of imported inputs entering domestic production. 
These two channels explain three-quarters of the transmission of an exchange rate appreciation to domestic prices.
By contrast, other channels reflecting the impact of global value chains (such as the price of exported inputs feeding through imported foreign production) play a more limited role, with marked cross-countries heterogeneity.
Hence, only one-fourth of the elasticity of the HCE deflator to the exchange rate is attributable to participation in global value chains."

*	In the introduction, main findings are discussed only for the third and fourth exercise in the paper but not for the first two 

C’est quoi le 1er et 2e ?

*	The motivation and contribution of the paper to the literature should be included in the introduction.  Section 1 could be thus incorporated in the introduction.
*	I would consider dropping section 1, but including a deeper and more concise discussion of the related literature.  This paper relates to the ERPT literature but also to the large macro-trade literature that sheds light on the transmission of shocks across countries through input-output linkages. The contribution of the paper to each of these strands should be clearly discussed.

Violaine s’occupe de ces trois points. Hadrien lui donne un coup de main sur la littérature (rapport ERPT). Stefan Schleffer ? Box ERPT ?

*	Section 2 should be re-organised. The focus of the section should be on the derivation of the HCE deflator elasticity. The data could be discussed in a separate section.
Violaine Data section 1
Guillaume refocus section 2

As suggested, we discuss the data sources and compare the different databases in a separate section  (section 1). Section 2 now only has the derivation of the HCE deflator elasticity.

*	I am unsure of the purpose of section 2.1.   I am guessing the authors wanted to show that the effect of a change in production costs is different from that due to a change in the exchange rate. But isn't that shown in Online Appendix D?

Thank you for this comment. This section was meant initially as an introduction to the rest of the analysis, but we agree it was actually redundant. We have moved it to Online Appendix. 

*	The analysis in section 4.3 is poorly explained. Are all countries included when equation (17) is estimated? What are the estimated coefficients? Why is the estimated specification that in equation (17)? What happens if the time-varying variables are replaced by time fixed-effects?

Thank you for this comment. We have changed that section. We now explain why we do not use the time-fixed effects. We give and comment the regression results of equation 17 (now 16) (and explain why we are more interested in the goodness-of-fit than the coefficient value and coefficients). We give the number of countries and years over which the equation is estimated. We hope to have thus clarified the discussion and answered your concerns

*	For the exercise in 4.3 to be helpful, it would be good if the authors could validate their estimated elasticities. Is there any other study that for a subset of the sampled countries has obtained relatively precise estimated HCE deflator elasticities?  In the abstract, the authors mention their elasticity estimates are in line with the literature- so that should be feasible. A lot of the correlations highlighted in the paper feel mechanical.

-	Page numbers should be included.
-	The order of the online Appendices does not follow the order in which they are referred to in the text.
-	In section 2, gamma_k should be gamma_n in the expressions for p_n and x_n.

Thank you for bringing these aspects to our attention : they have been dealt with.
