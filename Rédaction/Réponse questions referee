Reviewer #1: This paper uses an accounting approach to estimate the elasticity of the household consumption expenditure (HCE) deflator to the exchange rate. After estimating these elasticities for many countries, it explores their heterogeneity across countries and over time. The authors find that countries the consume a larger share of imported goods and services experience higher elasticities. Countries vary in the determinants of the HCE deflator elasticity (e.g. consumption of domestic vs. imported good; sector composition). Changes in the use of imported inputs have affected the value of these elasticities over time. Finally, the authors show that the estimated elasticities are well predicted by the share of imported consumption good in GDP and the share of imported inputs in GDP.
•	The paper is difficult to read. Part of it is the organisation of the information and another part of it is the exposition. I understand input-output linkages well and still had to think hard about all the relationships discussed in section 2, and various parts of the paper (I'll be specific in my comments below).

•	The analysis makes assumptions on the degree of the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) and currency pricing. These assumptions imply estimated elasticities are an upper bound. It would be great if the authors could incorporate a discussion of the consequences of this for their findings. While I do agree the assumptions bias estimates elasticities upwards, I am not sure the cross-country heterogeneity is correctly identified. If one looks at Figure 1, Taiwan has a greater elasticity than Canada but that might not be the case if the bias from the assumptions on Taiwan's calculations is worse than that on Canada's. This point is particularly important given that cross-country heterogeneity is explored in section 3.1. and 3.2.

•	The language in the introduction is not always clear. For example: "we assume that the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation is proportional across sector". At page 1 I was not sure to what the proportionality referred, only in section 2.3 I understood that it referred to the use of inputs whose price is affected. I also found confusing the discussion of channels iii) and iv) at page 2. Most readers are unfamiliar with input-output structures and have not thought of all the ways in which shocks propagate from one country to another through input-output linkages.
Guillaume :
•	Revoir la proportionnalité
•	Supprimer la discussion des channels dans l’intro et dire que c’est mieux expliqué ailleurs.
•	In the introduction, main findings are discussed only for the third and fourth exercise in the paper but not for the first two
C’est quoi le 1er et 2e ?
•	The motivation and contribution of the paper to the literature should be included in the introduction. Section 1 could be thus incorporated in the introduction.
•	I would consider dropping section 1, but including a deeper and more concise discussion of the related literature. This paper relates to the ERPT literature but also to the large macro-trade literature that sheds light on the transmission of shocks across countries through input-output linkages. The contribution of the paper to each of these strands should be clearly discussed.

•	Section 2 should be re-organised. The focus of the section should be on the derivation of the HCE deflator elasticity. 
The data could be discussed in a separate section. 

As suggested, we discuss the data in a separate section (section 1).

•	I am unsure of the purpose of section 2.1. I am guessing the authors wanted to show that the effect of a change in production costs is different from that due to a change in the exchange rate. But isn't that shown in Online Appendix D?

•	The analysis in section 4.3 is poorly explained. Are all countries included when equation (17) is estimated? What are the estimated coefficients? Why is the estimated specification that in equation (17)? What happens if the time-varying variables are replaced by time fixed-effects?
Guillaume. Le dernier point : avec TVV, on ne peut plus extrapoler.
•	For the exercise in 4.3 to be helpful, it would be good if the authors could validate their estimated elasticities. Is there any other study that for a subset of the sampled countries has obtained relatively precise estimated HCE deflator elasticities? In the abstract, the authors mention their elasticity estimates are in line with the literature- so that should be feasible. A lot of the correlations highlighted in the paper feel mechanical.

•	Page numbers should be included.
•	The order of the online Appendices does not follow the order in which they are referred to in the text.
•	In section 2, gamma_k should be gamma_n in the expressions for p_n and x_n.
