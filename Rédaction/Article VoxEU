The heterogeneous impact of exchange rate movements on inflation

%Abstract: 80 mots 5
Understanding how exchange rate movements will impact inflation is critically important for monetary policy. 
Using several datasets covering most advanced and emerging economies, this column analyses which countries and sectors are under pressure to adjust their prices when subject to an exchange rate variation.
It finds that the elasticity of consumer prices to the exchange rate is heterogeneous across countries, reflecting differences in foreign product content of consumption and intermediate products.

%à faire: introduire le débat en citant d'autres articles VoxEU
In a recent paper (Camatte et al., 2021), we analyse the impact of exchange rate variations on domestic consumer prices using several datasets covering most advanced and emerging economies, from 1995 to 2019.
We perform an accounting exercise based on information contained in world input-output tables. 
Our accounting approach helps identify which countries and sectors are under pressure to adjust their prices when subject to an exchange rate variation

% Premier apport de notre étude: hétérogénéité entre pays
The impact of exchange rate variations on consumer prices is heterogeneous across countries %titre en gras de la partie

In line with the existing literature, we find that in response to a 1% appreciation of the domestic currency, domestic consumer prices decrease
by arround 0.10% on average at the world level. 
The impact of exchange rate variations on consumer prices has remained broadly stable over the past two decades.
The impact of a 1% exchange rate fluctuation on domestic prices is heterogeneous across countries.
It ranges from 0.05% to 0.22%, reflecting different degrees of openness to trade and differences in foreign product content in domestic consumption.
The elasticity is lower for large advanced and developing countries. 
For instance, we find an elasticity of 0.06 for the US.
Within the euro area, the elasticity of domestic consumer prices differs substantially, ranging from 0.07 in Italy to 0.18 in Ireland, a small open economy with a large traded sector and a large share of trade outside the euro area.
For larger countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and countries whose trade is concentrated with euro area partners (such as Portugal and Greece), the elasticity is close to 0.10, reflecting a lower degree of openness to trade.
The elasticity is twice higher for small open economies like Luxembourg, Malta, Slovakia and Ireland.
The value of the elasticity is closely, but not perfectly, related to the share of imported goods and services (from outside the euro area for euro area countries) in household consumption.
The higher the country’s import share in consumption, the higher the elasticity of domestic consumer prices to the exchange rate.
We document the evolution over time of the impact of exchange rate variations on consumer prices.
In line with the existing literature, we find that in response to a 1% appreciation of the domestic currency, domestic consumer prices decrease by around 0.10% on average at the world level.
The impact of exchange rate variations on consumer prices has remained broadly stable over the past two decades. 

%Deuxieme apport: le rôle du dollar
Which countries are most impacted by an appreciation of the US dollar? %titre en gras de la partie

We estimate the impact of an appreciation of the US dollar on its trading partners. 
We rely on the simplifying assumption that exports are always invoiced in the exporter’s currency. 
Hence, although recent evidence shows that most international prices are set in one dominant currency (Boz et al. 2020), we do not take into account the large role of the U.S. dollar in international trade invoicing. 
The US example illustrates that countries are affected in proportion to their trading links with the country whose currency appreciates. 
We obtain the highest elasticities for the major trading partners of the US.
The elasticity of consumer prices to the USD amounts to 0.12 for Canada and 0.09 for Mexico.
The elasticity is below 0.06 for most euro area countries.
Ireland stands out, with an elasticity of 0.09, i.e. close to that of Canada and Mexico.
Indeed, the U.S. is Ireland’s major trading partner outside of the EU, even if a large portion of Irish imports from the US (pharmaceuticals and aircraft) are later exported by Irish-based firms without being purchased by Irish consumers, and therefore have a negligible contribution to domestic consumer goods inflation.

%Troisième apport: impact par produit
Sectors which experience the highest spillovers from an exchange rate appreciation. %titre en gras de la partie

Non-energy industrial goods explain the bulk of the impact of an exchange rate variation on consumer prices. 
Services also play a significant role, especially in advanced economies such as the US, Japan, Germany and France.
Although services are mainly produced domestically and do not rely much on imported inputs, they account for a substantial share of total consumption.
Thus, even small price changes have a large effect on domestic consumer prices.
